## OKX Staking: A Stable Way to Earn

**Staking** is one of the simplest and safest ways to earn on your crypto holdings. By locking tokens for a set period, you can enjoy steady yields while supporting the blockchain network.  

### Highlights:
- **80+ Tokens Supported**: Stake popular coins like Litecoin, Ripple, and Chainlink.
- **Flexible Lock Periods**: Choose between 15 to 120 days.
- **Yields**: Ranges from 5% for major tokens to over 70% for smaller projects.  

OKX also offers **ETH 2.0 staking**, where you can pool as little as 0.1 ETH and still earn rewards. The platform issues BETH tokens as proof of your stake, which can later be redeemed for ETH at a 1:1 ratio.

## Savings: Flexible and Low-Risk

For those who prefer low-risk options, the **OKX Savings Program** is ideal. Deposits in this program are used for margin loans, and interest is paid out hourly.  

### Benefits:
- **140+ Supported Tokens**: Most offer modest yields, but stablecoins like USDC and USDT can earn up to 10% APY.
- **Attractive Rates**: Some tokens, such as OMG, offer yields as high as 365% APY at the time of writing.
- **Insurance Protection**: A portion of loan interest is withheld to fund insurance, reducing risk for lenders.

## Fixed Income: Guaranteed Returns

The **Fixed Income** option functions like traditional bonds. Borrowers must fully collateralize their loans, and you earn interest when the term matures.  

### Key Details:
- **Supported Tokens**: USDT, BTC, ETH, OKB.
- **Term Lengths**: From 7 to 180 days.
- **Yields**: 1% to 4.5%, depending on the token and term.

## DeFi: Access Decentralized Finance with Ease

The **DeFi Portal** at OKX simplifies access to decentralized protocols like Compound, Aave, and SushiSwap. With no additional fees, you can supply liquidity and earn interest.  

While DeFi platforms can offer high rewards, they also come with risks like hacking or contract vulnerabilities. OKX provides access but explicitly states it isnâ€™t liable for third-party losses.

## Dual Investment: Advanced Strategies

**Dual Investment** allows you to speculate on future prices of Bitcoin or Ethereum while earning a fixed yield.  

### How It Works:
1. **Choose a Target Price**: For BTC or ETH.
2. **Subscription Terms**: Ranges from 15 hours to 302 days.
3. **Outcomes**:
   - If the target price is reached, your funds are converted to the target crypto.
   - If the target isnâ€™t reached, you keep your original funds plus interest.

This product is best suited for experienced investors familiar with options trading.

## Flash Deals: Time-Limited Opportunities

**Flash Deals** offer high APY on short-term investments but with limited slots and payout in alternative tokens.  

Example: A recent deal provided **110% APY on USDT deposits** for three days, but rewards were paid in MENGO tokens. While the yield is attractive, price fluctuations in payout tokens can affect overall returns.

## The OKX Carnival: Bonus Rewards

The **OKX Carnival** sweetens Flash Deals by offering free NFTs to participants. While the NFTs may not hold significant value initially, thereâ€™s potential for appreciation over time.
