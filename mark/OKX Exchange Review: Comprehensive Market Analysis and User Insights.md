## Notable Drawbacks of OKX

### 1. Limited Liquidity for Certain Coins
While OKX supports 300+ cryptocurrencies, some coins (e.g., OKDOT, LDT, DEVT) have low liquidity and market capitalization.

### 2. Mixed Company Reputation
OKX has faced challenges in the past:
- In 2020, withdrawals were paused for five weeks due to the temporary detainment of a key executive. OKX has since improved its private key management system.
- In December 2022, an outage caused by an Alibaba Cloud failure disrupted withdrawals for 12 hours. OKX compensated affected users and adopted a multi-cloud strategy to enhance system stability.

### 3. No Phone Support
OKX has suspended phone support due to security concerns. Customer inquiries are handled through text-based support, which may not address urgent issues promptly.
