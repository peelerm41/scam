## Interest Rate Setting and Distribution

### **1. Interest Rate Setting**
Users can set their **minimum lending APR** (Annual Percentage Rate) during subscription and adjust it on the order details page. Simple Earn matches lending bids with market demand every hour based on the following rules:

- **Minimum APR < Market APR:** Funds will be loaned at the market APR.
- **Minimum APR = Market APR:** Funds may be partially loaned or not loaned at all.
- **Minimum APR > Market APR:** Funds will not be loaned, and no interest will be earned for that hour.

#### Exceptions:
- If the total supply of funds is nearly exhausted, the market APR may rise to attract more lenders. In such cases, funds with a lower minimum APR might not be loaned.

#### Priority:
- For multiple lenders with the same minimum APR, loans are approved on a **first-come, first-served basis**.

### **2. Interest Calculation and Distribution**
- Hourly interest is distributed to users on the next hour (T+1) after their lending offer is matched.
- **Interest Formula:**  
  `Actual interest = Loan amount Ã— Current APR / 365 / 24 Ã— 85%`
  - 15% of the interest is retained as margin, while 85% is distributed to users.

### **3. Margin Usage**
- 15% of interest is deposited as margin to cover potential losses. If margin funds are insufficient, up to **50% of daily interest** may be used to cover losses, ensuring that users still earn interest daily.
