## Step-by-Step Guide to Contract Trading

You can customize your trading preferences before opening positions:
- **Cross Margin**: Uses all account assets as margin.  
- **Isolated Margin**: Limits margin to the selected position.  

You can also adjust the **leverage ratio** (from 0.01x to 125x) and choose your preferred trading unit (e.g., lots or coins).

### 4. Open and Close Positions
OKX supports various order types, including:

### 5. Key Differences Between Perpetual and Delivery Contracts

- **Expiry Date**:  
  Delivery contracts have a fixed expiration date. Upon expiration, the contract is settled at the average price of the final hour. Perpetual contracts, on the other hand, have no expiration date.
  
- **Funding Fees**:  
  Perpetual contracts use a funding mechanism to keep the contract price anchored to the spot price. Traders on one side (long or short) pay a funding fee to the other side based on market conditions.

- **Mark Price**:  
  Perpetual contracts calculate unrealized profit and loss using the mark price, reducing unnecessary liquidations during market volatility.

## Understanding Long and Short Positions

### What Does It Mean to Go Long?  
Going long, or "buying long," means you expect the price of an asset to rise. For example:
- You buy Bitcoin (BTC) at a lower price, anticipating a rise, and sell it at a higher price to make a profit.

### What Does It Mean to Go Short?  
Shorting, or "selling short," means you expect the price of an asset to fall. For example:
- You sell Bitcoin (BTC) at a higher price, anticipating a drop, and buy it back at a lower price to profit from the difference.

## How Traders Make Money with Contracts
By trading contracts, investors can profit from both rising and falling markets. Hereâ€™s how:
- **Profit in a Bull Market**: Buy long when you expect the asset price to rise.  
- **Profit in a Bear Market**: Sell short when you expect the asset price to fall.

## Additional Tips for Contract Trading

1. **Choose the Correct Deposit Network**  
   Ensure that the network selected during deposits matches the one youâ€™re using for the transaction.  
   
2. **Understand Leverage Risks**  
   High leverage increases potential gains but also magnifies losses. Use it wisely.  

3. **Be Aware of Funding Fees**  
   In perpetual contracts, funding fees are periodically exchanged between long and short traders. Monitor these fees carefully.

4. **Track Market Trends**  
   Use OKXâ€™s advanced trading tools, such as charts and technical indicators, to stay ahead of market movements.
