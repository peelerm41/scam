## OKX Pre-Market Trading Product Rules

### Overview

OKX's pre-market trading offers users the ability to engage in settlement contracts for tokens not yet listed on the platform. These contracts are USDT-margined and typically settle before the token is officially launched in the spot market. This feature enables users to participate in price discovery for new tokens in a secure and reliable environment.

### Product Mechanisms

Pre-market trading differs from standard settlement contracts in several ways. Itâ€™s essential for users to understand the specific mechanisms and risks before participating.

#### 1. Index Price

The latest transaction price of the pre-market settlement contract on OKX serves as the index price. This index price is also used to determine the settlement price of the contract.

#### 2. Settlement Mechanism

Pre-market trading contracts are USDT-settled digital asset contracts that settle on their expiry date based on a specific settlement price.

- **Settlement Time**:  
  If a new token is successfully issued and is confirmed to be launched in OKXâ€™s spot market, the pre-market settlement contract will settle before the token's spot market listing. The exact settlement date will be announced and displayed on the trading page once determined.  
  If the token issuance is canceled by the project team, or if no issuance plan is announced within six months, or due to risk control issues, OKX may decide to delist the contract earlier. The exact settlement date will be announced in such cases.

- **Settlement Price**:  
  The contract's settlement price is determined based on pre-market trading activity.

#### 3. Pricing Limits

- After the contract is generated:  
  - Buy order max price = 1-hour median price Ã— (1 + 15%)  
  - Sell order min price = 1-hour median price Ã— (1 â€“ 15%)  

- Within 60 minutes before settlement:  
  - Buy order max price = 1-hour median price Ã— (1 + 5%)  
  - Sell order min price = 1-hour median price Ã— (1 â€“ 5%)  

Median price = (Buy 1 price + Sell 1 price) / 2. Pricing limits are recalculated every minute.

#### 4. Mark Price

- Upper limit = Buy order max price.  
- Lower limit = Sell order min price.  

Mark price = Moving average of the contract's median price.

#### 5. Position Limit Rules

User positions in pre-market contracts are subject to both gradient tier limits and user-specific position limits.

- **Gradient Tier Limits**:  
  Maximum open position size is determined by leverage and tier table. Maintenance margin is calculated as the maintenance margin rate (MMR) Ã— position size.  

- **User-Specific Limits**:  
  Users must comply with both gradient tier limits and specific user limits simultaneously.

#### 6. Liquidation Mechanism

OKX's pre-market trading uses the same liquidation mechanism as its standard settlement market. Relevant details can be found here:

#### 7. Fees

## Important Considerations for Pre-Market Trading

### Risk Disclosure

While OKX strives to provide the best trading experience, pre-market contracts carry high risks due to lower liquidity, higher price volatility, and greater liquidation risks. Not all tokens traded as pre-market contracts will ultimately be listed on OKX. The platform reserves the right to adjust listing plans, extend or terminate contracts, and modify settlement dates as necessary.

### Understanding Settlement Contracts

Pre-market contracts have a fixed expiry date, tied to the launch of the underlying token. At settlement, contracts are settled in USDT, not the underlying token. Additionally, as these contracts trade before the token's launch, the price may not accurately reflect the token's eventual market price.

### FAQ

#### How is the settlement price determined?  
The settlement price is based on the pre-market trading activity leading up to settlement.

#### When does settlement occur?  
1. If the new token is successfully issued and will be listed on OKX, pre-market contracts settle before the token is launched on the spot market.  
2. If the project team cancels the token issuance or risk control issues arise, OKX may delist the contract earlier.

#### How are fees applied?  
- Trading fees: Same as standard contracts.  
- Settlement fees: 1%.  

#### Does pre-market trading affect the token's spot market price?  
Pre-market prices are determined by market activity and may not reflect the tokenâ€™s actual issuance price.
